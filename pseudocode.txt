full_fov = entire camera frame
boundary_box_1 = from left side fov to first sidewalk block
boundary_box_2 = from left side field of vision to second sidewalk block
boundary_box_3 = from second sidewalk block to door
motion_box = movement detected in boundary_box_1 > x% of fov - follow movement
follow_box = boundary box around person being followed 
start_recording = start the camera recording

if motion_box triggered
    start_recording
    turn on eyes
    draw follow_box
    if boundary_box_2
        turn eyes and head to left boundary_box_2
        follow movement with eyes to boundary_box_3
        follow with head to boundary_box_3
        center eyes

            follow movement with head to door
